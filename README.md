# We like soup!

Little soup app displaying the JA team's favorite winter soups in 2022. Used to test out Svelte and play around with some SVG animations.

This project is built with SvelteKit (see [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte)) and deployed using Vercel.
